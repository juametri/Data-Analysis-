# Climate Data Analysis

This is a personal project where I worked with climate-related data. The main goal was to practice the essential steps of data analysis: from cleaning to visualization and basic interpretation.

## 🔍 Project Objective

Apply what I’ve learned in a data analysis course using Python. I focused on:

- Detecting inconsistencies in the dataset  
- Identifying patterns or relationships between variables  
- Visually exploring the data to draw clear conclusions  

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Google Colab  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

## ✏️ What’s in this notebook

This notebook includes the following steps:

1. Dataset loading  
2. Error and anomaly detection  
3. Basic data cleaning  
4. Visualization of variables like temperature, humidity, and precipitation  
5. Some personal observations based on the charts  

I also included preprocessing steps like normalizing numerical columns and filtering out data inconsistencies (e.g., when the minimum temperature is higher than the maximum).

## 📌 Personal Notes

Although the project is simple, it helped me strengthen my understanding of Pandas and Matplotlib. It also reinforced the importance of having clean, organized data before jumping to conclusions.

I'm building this kind of notebook to gradually shape my portfolio as a future data analyst.

## 📁 Project Status

Completed. I might improve it later with deeper statistical analysis or simple modeling techniques.
